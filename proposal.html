            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>

            <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Course selection is a crucial aspect of every UW student's academic journey, yet it often becomes a source of frustration and headaches.
                The large student population in a public institute, coupled with popular courses filling up quickly,
                creates a competitive environment where students must wake up early and navigate a frantic registration process.
                Hence it is always neccessary to plan ahead. The current official platforms like MyPlan or DawgPath offer only a cursory glimpse
                into course content, which makes it exceedingly difficult to make informed decisions.
                As a result, UW students might find themselves enrolled in classes that are either too challenging or do not align with their academic plans,
                posing risks to their GPA and time management; and by then it is often too late to switch to another class. We need tools to efficiently provide detailed course information
                and evaluations to aid the decision making process, particularly when UW students need to balance their demanding study schedule and stressful course registration process.
            </p>

            <h3>Identify Information Technology Problem</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, UW students lack access to comprehensive course information, student feedback, and detailed examination/assignment details on the official platform.
                These are essential factors that students need to consider when deciding whether to enroll in a class or not.
                There are pieces of these information available from other sources. Manually searching for this information across various sources like Reddit is inefficient and unreliable. 
                Moreover, there's no guarantee of accuracy, and the information might be outdated due to changes in curriculum and course staff. Therefore,
                we require a tool that offers accurate and comprehensive information to help make rational decisions.


            <h3>Identify Existing Attempts</h3>
            <section>
                <h4>MyPlan Course Description</h4>
                <p>
                    The MyPlan website is the main platform we use to select courses, and there is some course descriptions
                    available when we are browsing the courses. While it provides some course descriptions and prerequisite information, it lacks essential details such as
                    course structure, syllabus, policies, and grading criteria. This gap makes it difficult for students to gain a comprehensive understanding of the course before enrollment.
                </p>

                <h4>DawgPath</h4>
                <p>
                    The main functionality of the DawgPath website is to include the course grade distribution over the past 5
                    years. This information can provide some insights into how difficult the class is, but the insight is very limited.
                    High or low grade points cannot show the value of the course, and should not be the determining aspect when
                    choosing courses.
                </p>

                <h4>RateMyProfessor</h4>
                <p>
                    RateMyProfessor is an unofficial website where anyone can post reviews for professors according to their
                    teaching quality and learning outcomes. However, since the website is unofficial, the reviews might
                    not be reliable. Also, students might give professors a very low rating because they didn't get a good grade,
                    so the reviews are highly biased. Moreover, the website primarily focuses on professor evaluations rather than course evaluations, 
                    making it challenging for students to assess course content accurately.
