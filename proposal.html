            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>

            <h3>Topic Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Course selection is an important part of our school life and we need to make sure that the classes
                we are taking every quarter are the ones we need. The currently accessible information on MyPlan or DawgPath
                is not sufficient to know all the details we need to make decisions, and sometimes we might end up
                taking a class that is too hard or does not fit our plan. We don't want to waste our time or put our
                GPA at risk, therefore we need some tools to provide detailed information and evaluation of the courses.
            </p>

            <h3>Identify Information Technology Problem</h3>
            <p>
                There are only pieces of information available from multiple sources. It's time-wasting and inefficient
                to look over all sources. Sometimes the information might be inaccurate or even misleading. Therefore we
                need accurate information that helps us understand the whole picture of the courses to make rational decisions.
            </p>


            <h3>Identify Existing Attempts</h3>
            <section>
                <h4>MyPlan Course Description</h4>
                <p>
                    The MyPlan website is the main platform we use to select courses, and there is some course descriptions
                    available when we are browsing the courses. However, these descriptions only provide some descriptions
                    of the course content and what are the pre-requisite courses. Students can hardly know anything about the
                    course structure, syllabus, policies, and grading of the course.
                </p>

                <h4>DawgPath</h4>
                <p>
                    The main functionality of the DawgPath website is to include the course grade distribution over the past 5
                    years. This information can provide some insights into how difficult the class is, but the insight is very limited.
                    High or low grade points cannot show the value of the course, and should not be the determining aspect when
                    choosing courses.
                </p>

                <h4>RateMyProfessor</h4>
                <p>
                    RateMyProfessor is an unofficial website where anyone can post reviews for professors according to their
                    teaching quality and learning outcomes. However, since the website is unofficial, the reviews might
                    not be reliable. Also, students might give professors a very low rating because they didn't get a good grade,
                    so the reviews are highly biased.
                </p>
