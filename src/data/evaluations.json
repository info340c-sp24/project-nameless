The course is beginner friendly and actually fun. My only complaints are that all grades came in at the very end of the quarter and the final website project was really rushed and thus difficult to execute."

There is about 3 reading quiz (online), 6 programming assignments and couple of lab assignments and group project. Ott try his best to answer any question 24/7 on discord. Overall, I really enjoy this class and learning R!"

At times expectations for projects were pretty unclear which led to frustration for some weeks. TAs were unhelpful, though taking close notes + reading textbook makes a high grade manageable"
